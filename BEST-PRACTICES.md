# üèÜ AWS 2-Tier Architecture Best Practices

This document outlines best practices for deploying and maintaining a robust 2-tier architecture on AWS using CloudFormation.

## üîí Security Best Practices

### 1. Network Security
- **Use private subnets** for application servers
- **Implement bastion hosts** for secure SSH access
- **Configure Security Groups** with least privilege principle
- **Enable VPC Flow Logs** for network monitoring
- **Use NAT Gateways** instead of NAT instances for better availability

### 2. Data Protection
- **Enable encryption at rest** for RDS databases
- **Use SSL/TLS** for all data in transit
- **Implement database backups** with point-in-time recovery
- **Store secrets** in AWS Secrets Manager or Systems Manager Parameter Store
- **Rotate database credentials** regularly

### 3. Access Control
- **Use IAM roles** instead of access keys for EC2 instances
- **Implement MFA** for privileged accounts
- **Follow least privilege principle** for IAM policies
- **Use resource-based policies** where appropriate
- **Regular audit** of IAM permissions

## üöÄ Performance Optimization

### 1. Application Tier
- **Use Auto Scaling Groups** for dynamic scaling
- **Configure health checks** properly
- **Implement connection pooling** for database connections
- **Use caching strategies** (ElastiCache, application-level caching)
- **Optimize instance types** based on workload patterns

### 2. Database Tier
- **Choose appropriate instance classes** based on IOPS requirements
- **Use read replicas** for read-heavy workloads
- **Implement proper indexing** strategies
- **Monitor slow query logs** and optimize queries
- **Consider database sharding** for large datasets

### 3. Load Balancing
- **Use Application Load Balancer** for HTTP/HTTPS traffic
- **Configure health checks** with appropriate intervals
- **Enable sticky sessions** only when necessary
- **Implement connection draining** for maintenance
- **Use multiple Availability Zones** for high availability

## üìä Monitoring and Observability

### 1. CloudWatch Metrics
```bash
# Key metrics to monitor
- EC2: CPU Utilization, Memory Usage, Disk I/O
- RDS: CPU Utilization, Database Connections, Read/Write IOPS
- ALB: Request Count, Response Time, Error Rate
- Auto Scaling: Group Size, Scaling Activities
```

### 2. Custom Metrics
- Application-specific performance indicators
- Business metrics (transactions per second, user activity)
- Error rates and response times
- Database query performance

### 3. Alerting Strategy
- **Critical alerts**: Database failures, high error rates
- **Warning alerts**: High CPU/memory usage, slow response times
- **Info alerts**: Scaling events, backup completions

## üí∞ Cost Optimization

### 1. Right-Sizing
- **Use AWS Compute Optimizer** recommendations
- **Monitor instance utilization** regularly
- **Consider Reserved Instances** for predictable workloads
- **Use Spot Instances** for non-critical workloads

### 2. Storage Optimization
- **Use GP3 volumes** instead of GP2 for better cost/performance
- **Implement S3 lifecycle policies** for log archival
- **Regular cleanup** of old snapshots and AMIs
- **Use S3 Intelligent Tiering** for varying access patterns

### 3. Database Cost Management
- **Use RDS Reserved Instances** for production databases
- **Consider Aurora Serverless** for variable workloads
- **Implement automated backup retention** policies
- **Monitor and optimize** storage usage

## üîÑ DevOps and Automation

### 1. Infrastructure as Code
- **Use CloudFormation templates** for all infrastructure
- **Version control** all templates and configurations
- **Implement parameter validation** in templates
- **Use nested stacks** for modular design
- **Tag all resources** consistently

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline
```yaml
# Example pipeline stages
1. Source: Git repository
2. Build: Application compilation/packaging
3. Test: Unit tests, integration tests
4. Security: Vulnerability scanning
5. Deploy: CloudFormation stack updates
6. Verify: Post-deployment testing
```

### 3. Deployment Strategies
- **Blue-Green deployments** for zero downtime
- **Rolling deployments** for gradual updates
- **Canary deployments** for risk mitigation
- **Rollback procedures** for quick recovery

## üõ°Ô∏è Disaster Recovery

### 1. Backup Strategy
- **Automated RDS backups** with appropriate retention
- **Regular AMI snapshots** of application servers
- **Cross-region backup replication** for critical data
- **Test backup restoration** procedures regularly

### 2. High Availability Design
- **Multi-AZ deployment** for RDS
- **Auto Scaling across multiple AZs** for application tier
- **Load balancer health checks** with failover
- **Database read replicas** in different AZs

### 3. Recovery Procedures
- **Document recovery steps** clearly
- **Automate recovery processes** where possible
- **Regular disaster recovery drills**
- **RTO/RPO targets** definition and testing

## üìã Operational Excellence

### 1. Documentation
- **Architecture diagrams** with current state
- **Runbooks** for common operations
- **Troubleshooting guides** for known issues
- **Change management** procedures

### 2. Maintenance Windows
- **Schedule regular maintenance** during low-traffic periods
- **Communicate changes** to stakeholders
- **Implement change approval** processes
- **Post-change validation** procedures

### 3. Capacity Planning
- **Monitor growth trends** and plan accordingly
- **Load testing** for peak capacity validation
- **Resource utilization** trending and forecasting
- **Scaling policies** optimization

## üîß Configuration Management

### 1. Environment Consistency
- **Use identical configurations** across environments
- **Parameter management** through SSM Parameter Store
- **Configuration drift detection** and remediation
- **Automated configuration deployment**

### 2. Version Control
- **Track all configuration changes**
- **Use semantic versioning** for releases
- **Maintain change logs** for all updates
- **Branch protection** for production configurations
